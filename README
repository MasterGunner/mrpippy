Mr Pippy: I'm no Mr Handy, but I try my best.

A python library for interacting with the Fallout 4 game and pip boy mobile app.
Implements both client and server-like logic.

Draws heavily from https://github.com/matzman666/PyPipboy who did much of the initial
reverse engineering work.

MrPippy only implements encode/decode and data management logic.
It intentionally does not concern itself with the mechanics of when to read/write,
event-based or threaded models, etc.


gPippy is a companion library built on gevent which implements the high level
interactions such as dispatching and waiting on RPC calls, performing keepalive,
sending data updates or reacting to changes.

It has support for both client and server operation.
